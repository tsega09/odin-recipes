        <figcaption>Shiro tastes surprisingly complex yet is surprisingly simple to prepare. </figcaption>
    </figure>
<p>Shiro offers a delightful complexity despite its remarkably easy preparation. While having a few specialty 
    ingredients is essential, I guarantee that even the meat enthusiasts in your group will be 
    asking for seconds â€“ a phenomenon witnessed at my own party.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
<li>1\2 cup oil</li>
&nbsp;
<li>1\2 cup chickpea flour</li>
&nbsp;
<li>2 medium onions pureed</li>
&nbsp;
<li>1 roma tomato pureed</li>
&nbsp;
<li>4 cloves of garlic chopped</li>
&nbsp;
<li>2 tablespoons niter kibbeh Ethiopian spiced clarified butter</li>
&nbsp;
<li>2 to 2 1\2 cups of water</li>
&nbsp;
<li>3 tablespoons berbere spice</li>
&nbsp;
<li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
&nbsp;
<li>1\2 teaspoon sugar</li>
&nbsp;
<li>Salt to taste</li>
&nbsp;
<li>1 jalepeno chopped (optional)</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
<li>Bring a heavy bottom stockpot to medium heat. Add pureed onions to the 
    dry pan, and saute until they become dry and start to take on color- about 
    4-5 minutes. Add the oil and berbere spice. Saute for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
    &nbsp;
<li>Next add tomato and chopped garlic. Saute for 2-3 minutes more.</li>
&nbsp;
<li>Now start whisking in about half of the chickpea flour. Gradually start to 
    add about 1 cup of water. Whisk in the remaining chickpea flour and an additional 
    1 cup of water. Whisk until mixture is very smooth. Add remaining 1\2 
    cup of water if you prefer your shiro a little thinner.</li>
    &nbsp;
<li>Heat until the shiro begins to pop (simmer). Then add the niter kibbeh, garlic powder, 
    sugar, and salt to taste, stirring until combined.</li>
    &nbsp;
<li>Simmer for about 5-10 minutes over low heat until the flavors combine and the 
    oil separates slightly from the shiro.</li>
    &nbsp;
<li>Garnish with jalepeno, if desired.</li>
&nbsp;
<li>Serve with fresh injera.</li>
